This project uses [A-Frame](http://aframe.io) to create a WebVR space.

People tend to  behave differently when they are entering a religious place like a temple, because they are taught here gods can see you and know your desires. The transition of human behavior inspires me to import Taiwan's religious culture and Chinese calligraphy aesthetics in virtual reality. Importing the cultural ritual such as "pray", "light an incense stick", in this VR space players can trigger visual effects by clicking specific objects.
